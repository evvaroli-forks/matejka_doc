PC=Player Character, in relation to games, especially RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons, Final Fantasy, WoW, etc. The PC is any character played by... a... player. Think of it as any character which you directly control. The corollary is NPC, or Non-Player Character, which is any character which is played by the GM (Game Master), Computer, etc., which may or may not be a civilian who doesn't do anything but talk to the PCs.
