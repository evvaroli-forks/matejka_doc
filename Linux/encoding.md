# Base64

## Base64 Encoding a String

To base64 encode string you can pipe an echo command into the base64 command-line tool. To ensure no extra, hidden characters are added use the `-n` flag.

Without the `-n` flag you may capture a hidden characters, like line returns or spaces, which will corrupt your base64 encoding. 

```bash
echo -n 'my-string' | base64
```

Which will output the following

```bash
bXktc3RyaW5n
```



## Base64 Encoding a File

To base64 encode a file

```bash
base64 /path/to/file
```

This will output a very long, base64 encoded string. You may want to write the stdout to file instead.

```none
bas64 /path/to/file > output.txt
```

## Decoding Strings

To decode with base64 you need to use the `--decode` flag. With encoded string, you can pipe an echo command into base64 as you did to encode it. 

Using the example encoding shown above, letâ€™s decode it back into its original form.

```none
echo -n 'bXktc3RyaW5n' | base64 --decode
```

Provided your encoding was not corrupted the output should be your original string.

## Decoding Files

To decode a file with contents that are base64 encoded, you simply provide the path of the file with the `--decode` flag. 

```none
base64 --decode /path/to/file
```

As with encoding files, the output will be a very long string of the original file. You may want to output stdout directly to a file.

```none
base64 --decode /path/to/file > output.txt
```
